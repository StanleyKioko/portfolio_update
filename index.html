            <h5>KEMRI Hackathon</h5>
            <div class="pra">
                <p>As part of a recent hackathon, I had the opportunity to work with customer data for the Kenya Medical Research Institute.<br>
                     My task was to clean and analyze the data, and to identify ways to improve customer satisfaction.<br>
                      Using a variety of techniques, including data cleaning and visualization, I was able to uncover key insights into the Institute's customer base.<br>
                      Specifically, I found that delays in receiving test results and a lack of awareness of the Institute's full range of services were key areas for improvement.<br>
                       <!--By recommending changes to expedite results and launch an outreach campaign, I believe that my analysis can help the Institute improve customer satisfaction and retention.<br>
                        Overall, this project provided a valuable opportunity to apply my skills in data analysis to a real-world problem, and I am proud of the insights and recommendations that I was able to generate.-->

            <h5>Mail Customer Analysis</h5>
            <div class="pra">
                <p> I conducted an in-depth analysis of customer data from a mall to help the mall managers make informed decisions about advertising to target groups. 
                    The analysis involved cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability
                    Based on the insights gained from the analysis, I made recommendations to the mall managers on which target groups to advertise more to.
                    Overall, the project helped the mall to better understand their customers and make data-driven decisions that improved their marketing strategies and increased sales.

            <h5>Customer Segmentation and Clustering</h5>
            <div class="pra">
                <p>The aim of this project was to identify the most important customer segments of a mall based on income, age, and shopping behavior.
                    Using data analysis techniques,  I segmented customers based on their income, age, and shopping behavior, and identified the key characteristics and needs of each segment.
                    This information can then be used to tailor marketing campaigns and promotions that are more likely to resonate with each customer segment,
                     ultimately improving customer engagement and increasing revenue for the mall.

            <h5>Heart Disease Prediction</h5>
            <div class="pra">
                <p>The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease based on a set of patient attributes. 
                    To achieve this, I utilized a dataset of patient records and employed feature engineering techniques to select the most relevant variables for the model. 
                     The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a 
                    predictive tool that can assist healthcare professionals in the early detection and management of heart disease, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

            <h5>Abalone Age Prediction</h5>
            <div class="pra">
                <p>As part of this project, I developed a machine learning algorithm using physical measurements to predict the age of abalones.
                    By accurately predicting the age of abalones, the algorithm can aid in the sustainable management of abalone populations, 
                    as well as in the seafood industry's ability to ensure that abalones reach the appropriate market size. 
                    The project involved extensive data preparation, 
                    feature engineering, and model selection, and the resulting algorithm has potential applications in both academic research and industry.
